              The machinery includes an agitator that can be started and
              stopped. We proposed that the start/stop buttons replace one
              another depending on the current state of the machinery. We also
              felt that a graph representing current and past speeds of the
              agitator could be potentially useful.

            <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 14px;">
              The machinery also includes sensors for weight calibration. We
              proposed a more intuitive way of displaying the process that a
              user must take to perform the weight calibration. The progress bar
              provides a visual cue, showing users how far they have proceeded
              through calibration. "STEP 1-4" is also included for added
              clarity.

              In the "STEP" section, instructional text is distinguished from
              text describing current machine activity by color. While the
              machine is active, controls that can not be operated are faded out
              to indicate to the user that they are inactive, such as the weight
              input and the "Calibrate" button.

            <h5 style="text-align: left;">The Challenge</h5>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
              Our client is a medical supply company, and has a wide range of
              machinery in their manufacturing facilities. Technicians often
              operate this machinery facilitated by interactive digital
              interfaces. Our goal is to create a machinery interface that would
              be clearly organized for both experienced and inexperienced
              technicians.
            </p>
            <h5 style="text-align: left;">The Goal</h5>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
              Redesign the Smart Mixer interface in such a way that its
              information architecture is clear, sufficient space is allocated
              for application elements, and new users are able to proceed
              through the operation process.
            </p>
            <h5 style="text-align: left;">Approach</h5>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
              This redesign project is still in-progress, and as of March 2020,
              the team has not yet received access to investigate the machinery
              itself nor to work directly with users. In order to begin the
              visual design process prior to having these opportunities, I
              analyzed the visual representation of information architecture as
              represented by the current model. The original interface being
              used by the client had two "layers" of tabs, as shown in my
              version. However, the primary tabs were placed above the page
              content, while the secondary tabs were placed below the page
              content. We felt that this was counterintuitive, and that it was
              unclear that the core page information pertained to the secondary
              tab, within the first tab.
            </p>
            <h5 style="text-align: left;">The Outcome</h5>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
              Our next step is to receive access to interactive demonstrations
              of the machinery while in use. We would also like to connect with
              the operators of this machinery, so we can contextualize its use
              in their everyday work responsibilities, their level of
              experience, the training they have received, and the customizable
              information they may or may not input into the interface.
