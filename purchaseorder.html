              One of the proposed methods of organizing order line items, from
              earlier in the design process. We felt that tiles could be a
              potential way of organizing key line item information, visually
              grouping item details. There are also several search fields for
              filtering line items by their relevant information.
            </p>

          <div class="col">
            <h5 style="text-align: left;">The Challenge</h5>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
              The client, a medical supply company, needed an internal tool to
              organize and track their purchase orders. This tool would be used
              primarily by project managers, and would contain information on
              products, partner companies, and contact information as well. The
              client had an existing tool to perform these tasks, but it was
              visually very complex and information-heavy, and there was no
              built-in method for filtering through order information.
            </p>
            <h5 style="text-align: left;">The Goal</h5>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
              Reorganize information such that each screen contained only
              specific information, rather than as much information as possible
              on one screen. Clarify the application information architecture,
              such that users were able to orient themselves within the proper
              stage in the purchase order management process.
            </p>
            <h5 style="text-align: left;">Approach</h5>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
              We met continually with the client team, and conducted the design
              process simultaneously with the development process. While the
              development team continued to refine the application
              functionality, I, as the lead designer, was in regular
              communication directly with the client team, who used the
              application themselves as part of their day-to-day
              responsibilities.<br /><br />Because of our regular communication,
              I was able to get a thorough understanding of the requirements and
              scale of the application - for example, how many line items could
              be part of one order, and by which fields users were most likely
              to search when locating a specific line item. Periodically,
              throughout the design process, I sent iterations of my design work
              directly to the client team, who would review them based on their
              own needs, and send their feedback. <br /><br />
              I also functioned as a front-end developer for this project, and I
              implemented the design updates into the final code base in
              HTML/CSS, with use of the Meteor framework.
            </p>
            <h5 style="text-align: left;">The Outcome</h5>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
              The final version of this project became the client's primary tool
              for purchase order tracking.
