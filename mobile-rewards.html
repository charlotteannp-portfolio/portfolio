      <h4>Mobile Rewards Application</h4>
      <p>Infosys Client</p>
      <div class="container">
        <!-- <div class="row"> -->
        <img

            <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 14px;">
              One of the difficulties with the existing application was that
              users were not clearly notified of an active time frame for each
              rewards' use. We proposed timestamps/markers on the home screen to
              let users know how much time they had to take advantage of a
              reward.
            </p>
            <br /><br /><br />
            <img
              src="tmobile-filter.png"
              style="max-width: 350px;"
            /><br /><br />
            <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 14px;">
              Customers often expressed dissatisfaction with the rewards
              available to them. We thought that a filter that could display
              relevant rewards based on category could help users find rewards
              that they would enjoy.<br /><br />Additionally, many users
              reported seeing rewards advertised that were not geographically
              accessible for them. We proposed adding location services to the
              application, so rewards could display depending on which offers
              were physically accessible.

              In the "STEP" section, instructional text is distinguished from
              text describing current machine activity by color. While the
              machine is active, controls that can not be operated are faded out
              to indicate to the user that they are inactive, such as the weight
              input and the "Calibrate" button.

            <h5 style="text-align: left;">The Challenge</h5>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
              Our client is a leading mobile service provider. They have a
              mobile application for delivering rewards to customers, such as
              free/discounted food, travel deals, gas rewards, and limited
              merchandise. Our goal was to make their rewards application easier
              to use and more satisfying for customers. In other words, we
              wanted customers to feel like having this application, and
              redeeming rewards regularly, was "worth it."
            </p>
            <h5 style="text-align: left;">The Goal</h5>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
              We wanted to increase the usage of this rewards application by
              minimizing the pains associated with its use - uninteresting
              rewards, multiple logins, and external registrations. We wanted to
              present rewards in such a way that users would find them easy to
              access, redeem, and enjoy.
            </p>
            <h5 style="text-align: left;">Approach</h5>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
              We conducted an extensive research process that included
              surveying, in-person interviewing, heuristic evaluaution, and
              journey mapping. We distributed an online survey to as many
              potential users of this mobile provider that we could access. We
              also visited several brick-and-mortar stores for the service
              provider, and spoke with visitors to the store about their
              experiences with the application. <br />
              <br />
              After compiling and analyzing our findings, we transitioned into
              in-office analysis of the original application features. We used
              Nielsen Norman Group's
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/"
                >Usability Heuristics</a
              >
              to assess the usability of the current application, and addressed
              any shortcomings in the redesign.
            </p>
            <h5 style="text-align: left;">The Outcome</h5>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
              Our team presented the proposed redesign to the client. The client
              currently uses Infosys's services for back end software
              development.

            <br /><br />
            <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 14px;">
              One of the key issues with the original rewards application was
              that, when redeeming a reward, users often were redirected outside
              of the app, either to a partnering company's app or to the
              browser. This could be discouraging for users, who did not want to
              put their credit card and/or email address into a different
              company's application. We felt that the most streamlined way for
              users to redeem rewards would be an in-app QR code that populated
              when the user tapped a "Redeem" button.
